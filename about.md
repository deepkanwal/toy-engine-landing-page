Toy Engine lets you create side-scrolling games on your iPad. Design your game world using a drag and drop level editor. Add custom behaviour using visual scripting. After you're done, share your creations online for others to play and download.

Visual scripting is at the core of Toy Engine. It allows you do anything from moving an enemy back and forth, to recreating levels from popular side scrolling games. Plus, you'll learn about programming constructs such as events, functions and variables. The visual scripting interface in Toy Engine is a very simplified take on [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/)'s visual scripting feature called Blueprints.

We recommend looking into the 'Learn' section of the app to see the kinds of things you can do with Toy Engine. We've also created several [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWOvd5iPn8dkKHcJGXQgxraNADbmQXwMn) that are a good reference point to start creating your own levels.

Toy Engine was initially developed for a capstone undergrad project at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/).

We made use of [Kenney asset packs](http://kenney.nl/assets/) for the game art and [Batch](http://adamwhitcroft.com/batch/) for UI icons.
