Toy Engine uses Google Analytics to collect traffic data. This includes data such as user interactions within the app, devices used, error logs, and location (granularity is limited to city). The data is not personally identifiable. Toy Engine uses Google Analytics to determine the usage of the different areas of the app and to be notified of errors. This will allow us to determine which areas of the app we should target for future updates.

Crashlytics is also used to to send back logs in the event of a crash. This includes information about the device the crash occured on (e.g. iOS version, orientation, system usage). This information is used to allow us to respond to crashes as they happen.

We may share anonymous statistics regarding the application usage. This includes data such as the total number of active users, number of downloads, number of purchases of an IAP, etc.
